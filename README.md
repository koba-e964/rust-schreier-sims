# rust-schreier-sims
An implementation of Schreier-Sims algorithm in group theory.

This repository gives an implementation of [Schreier-Sims algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreier%E2%80%93Sims_algorithm).
You can try this by replacing main() function with e.g. the following:
```
fn main() {
    // Star, G = <(0 n-1), (1 n-1), ...> = S_n, |G| = n!
    let n = 20;
    let mut gen = vec![];
    for i in 0..n - 1 {
        let mut p = vec![0; n];
        for j in 0..n {
            p[j] = j;
        }
        p.swap(i, n - 1);
        gen.push(Perm::new(p));
    }
    println!("order = {}", order(n, &gen)); // Finds the order of G.
}
```
In this example, `gen` becomes a list of transpositions (i n-1) for every i = 0, ..., n - 2, and the group generated by `gen` is exactly the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> of degree n. Therefore, its order is n!.
